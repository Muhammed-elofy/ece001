Go is fairly a new system-level programming language that has a focused vocabulary and simple scoping rules. It blends the best aspects of functional programming and object-oriented styles. Go is the fastest-growing language on Github, meant to replace languages like Java and C++.
A Stack Overflow survey reveals that Go is the fifth most preferred language among developers today. This is because, Go solves issues like slow compilation and execution in large distributed software systems.


This speed advantage has made Go a critical component of cloud infrastructure. So, if you are planning to work in a serverless ecosystem, Go is the language for you.
